# Speakify â€“ Text-to-Speech Capstone Project

**Live Demo:** [Speakify on GitHub Pages](https://YourUsername.github.io/YourRepoName/)

## Overview

Speakify is a fun and interactive **Text-to-Speech (TTS) web app** that converts typed text into natural-sounding speech. It supports multiple languages and voices, with a lively frontend featuring emojis and animations.

This project is a **capstone for cloud computing and frontend development**, integrating **AWS Lambda** for backend TTS processing and **GitHub Pages** for hosting the frontend.

- Styling & Animations: TailwindCSS, CSS animations

## Installation / Run Locally

1. Clone the repo:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgracemahama-lab/speakify-tts.git

Open index.html in a browser.

The frontend fetches audio from the live AWS Lambda backend, so no additional backend setup is required.


How It Works

User types text into the Speakify input box.

Click GENERATE to send text to the AWS Lambda TTS function.

Lambda uses Amazon Polly to generate audio.

Frontend receives the audio (base64), converts it to a playable format, and plays it.

Animated emojis/avatar react in real time.
